## Start Developing

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (You can also use npm, pnpm, ...)
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

For starters, I recommend using Expo Go, it's the quickest way to get going. For production, a development build should be used.
